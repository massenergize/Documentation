On this board, you will find all the necessary information needed to get started as a developer with making changes and building on anything on the **MassEnergize**
user portal[**Made with React**]. This file will give directions to very tricky, and important files as well as details that make up the core functionality of the whole site.

and simple instructions to how to use custom components that have been created.
